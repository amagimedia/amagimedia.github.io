quotes:
- quote: This is a cost-effective way of reaching people. If you want to target people in a region or town, why spend money for spots that are beamed nationally? Instead, you could pay a fraction of that for spots beamed in that particular city.
  source: Angshu Mallick, chief operating officer, Adani Wilmar
- quote: Zee has always led the Indian TV industry. By partnering with Amagi, we are once again, making history. We are very happy to tie up with Amagi, and make available a whole new set of targeting options for advertisers.
  source: Ashish Sehgal, Chief Sales Officer, Zee TV
- quote: What Amagi offers is exactly what a big client would be interested in, say when they want to test market a product or service in a single geography.
