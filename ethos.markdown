            <p>We are a unique mix of media &amp; technology – we bring the latest in technology to traditional broadcast media to create a new TV media advertising platform – <span class="highlight">targeted TV ad</span>.</p>
            <p> People often ask us if we are a technology firm, media firm or an advertising firm. We aren't any of them.</p>

        <p><em>Baskar is a dreamer, always in an ideal world, thinking in the most optimistic fashion ever (whoever said entrepreneurs are optimists, would certainly have seen Baskar up and close). Loves to explore technology solution to business problems. Claims to be a great programmer, although he has not written a single line of code for the last ten years!</em></p>
