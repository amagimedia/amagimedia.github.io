# About Amagi

Amagi Media Labs is the leader in providing geographic targeting of TV advertising. It is a next generation TV ad network that enables advertisers to target their spends effectively on TV. 

With Amagi, brands can focus their advertising in select cities or regions on pan-India TV channels. Amagi works with multiple TV channels across the genres of GECs, movies, sports, news and lifestyle.

##Amagi India

With a view to enable growing businesses to advertise on TV locally, Amagi has spread its network across India. Present in over 105 cities with sales presence in 30 of them including metros, tier-1 and tier-2 cities,  Amagi is the new wave in making TV advertising affordable. 

Amagi’s content bouquet includes Times Now/ET Now, Zee News/Zee Business, Ten Sports/Ten Cricket, IBN7, CNBC Awaaz, CNN-IBN, NICK, UTV Movies, Zoom, Maa Group and Udaya Group. 

Amagi provides advertisers the opportunity to leverage a medium like TV and still advertise only to a relevant target group. This is done by purchasing inventory from a national channel and inserting relevant advertising for a particular region. This way, the same ad spot gets multiple advertisers, thereby benefitting them since the spot is seen only in the city/ region that they require. 

Amagi also supports clients in providing creative solutions for advertisements and provides end to end solutions including production.

##Amagi International

Amagi Media Labs’ cloud-based transmission technology was created to address the growing need of TV networks to localize content in their common feeds to multiple countries. Instead of running a completely new feed, broadcasters can now cost effectively opt-out of certain content in select countries where they don’t own content rights or have regulatory challenges. 

Broadcasters having common multi-country broadcast feeds can adapt Amagi’s patent-pending transmission technology to easily fine-tune programming played out in individual countries.  Broadcaster can ‘opt out’ specific programs or even specific spot advertising in a country and replace it with some other locally relevant programs for the country by utilizing Amagi’s revolutionary cloud-based transmission infrastructure.

Amagi aims to revolutionise TV broadcasting by using its cloud-porting technology to empower many more such innovations on TV, not to mention bringing down the overhead costs dramatically.
