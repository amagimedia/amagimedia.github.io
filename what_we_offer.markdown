          <h2>Why Target on TV?</h2>
          <p>First, why TV?</p>
          <ul class="indent"><li>Because TV outperforms every other media by a long way in building memorable brands and delivering the highest sales. </li></ul>
          <p>Then, why targeted TV?</p>
          <ul class="indent">
            <li>Because - Traditional TV is expensive and wasteful.</li>
            <li>Because - Your brands / businesses are regional, but the best / most popular TV channels are national.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Targeted TV Advertising is:</p>
          <ul class="indent">
            <li>Unconventional - Who says that TV advertising is not for you? Breaking the myth, amagi provides services that help you advertising locally on national TV.</li>

            <li>Value for money - When you advertise with amagi, you pay only for the city you require, thereby paying a fraction of the channel's national rates. Your brand gets the exposure on national TV at a price that is truly local!</li>

          <h2>How it Works?</h2>
          <img class="" src="/img/amagi/how_it_works.png" />
          <p>amagi media has developed proprietary, patent-pending technology which enables automatic AV-recognition based ad-splicing. 
          This is world’s first and only AV watermark and fingerprint-based targeted ad-insertion technology. Features include: </p>
          <ul class="indent">
            <li>Specific ads on the same channel to be replaced with different ads in different regions</li>
            <li>On-screen elements including graphics, bugs, scrolls, bands etc. to be dynamically replaced/inserted at a regional level based on automatic recognition of content</li>
            <li>Works across cable, terrestrial, IP and DTH platforms</li>
            <li>Automatic ad-recognition-based targeted ad insertion</li>
            <li>Based on audio-video signature matching and watermarking</li>
            <li>With ZERO integration needed on broadcaster-end</li>
            <li>Multiple ad transports for targeted ads(IP, satellite spectrum)</li>
            <li>Seamless transition from national ads to targeted ads and back</li>
          </ul>


          <p>In India where consumers’ preferences are diverse, companies have built products/offerings to address specific regional requirements. But till recently, these companies did not have an option to market their products regionally  on TV due to lack of viable media options; national TV was inefficient due to the inherent spill-over that comes along with broadcasting.</p>

          <p>amagi comes into play to solve this seemingly never ending tussle between a brand’s requirement and the media options available for a marketer. With Amagi, Advertisers select regions where they want to advertise on large  TV channels thereby improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the campaign.</p>

          <p>Amagi’s platform (named DART) allows completely seamless replacement of specific ad spots/content on digital and analog platforms without any apriori knowledge of broadcaster schedules or out-of-band signalling like cue-tones or SCTE-35. It is an end-to-end platform including:</p>
          <ul class="indent">
            <li>backend ingest, scheduling &amp; billing systems to enable centralized scheduling of local content across hundreds or thousands of regional splits</li>
            <li>cloud-based distribution system to distribute content and local schedules across all regions</li>
            <li>broadcaster-end watermarking server which can watermark assets being broadcast and automatically distribute signatures to cloud platform </li>
            <li>edge-based device that can seamlessly recognize and splice local content/ads into the TV stream</li>
          </ul>

          <p>amagi has more than 1000 installations and has live systems across 3 continents working with multiple broadcasters and has been inserted tens of millions of ad/content secondages across geographies.</p>
