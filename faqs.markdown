      <a href='/faqs#' class='toggle-btn'>When you are inserting the local ad, aren't you changing the content of the channel? What happens to other ads then? </a>
      <div class='toggle-content'>
        <p>Like any other advertiser, amagi buys space from the channel. Once we buy a particular spot we slice it region-wise and sell the same spot to different advertisers in different regions. We don't replace any national ads but only the ad space which we have purchased. In such a way, no content/ad gets replaced.</p>
